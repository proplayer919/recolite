# Recolite - The platform for development

Recolite is basically a platform where it takes a Recolite Project and runs it safely and securely in a sandbox on the cloud.

## Recolite Projects

Recolite Projects can be anything. From a lone python file to a enormous java project. Recolite can run it on the cloud. It compresses the project into the re.colite file in your project, and all you need to do is upload it t the app! It is quite simple and easy.
